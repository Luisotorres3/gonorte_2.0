She is always attentive, corrects every exercise and motivates you from minute one, challenging you in a way that makes you feel capable and full of energy. And the most surprising thing is that, even being remote, I never imagined an online training could be so effective. In less than three months I have achieved results I never imagined, and I know this is just the beginning. I'm so happy I found her and I have no plans to stop. She is a wonderful coach.",
